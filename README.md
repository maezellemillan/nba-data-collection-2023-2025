# NBA Data Collection 2023-2025
This Python code uses the NBA API to scrape game logs, box scores, and player shooting splits from the NBA stats website for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons. I automate data collection using loops and API calls, incorporating parallel requests and exponential backoff with random jitter to avoid API blocking.

**Objective**: The primary goal for collecting this data is to evaluate Coby Whiteâ€™s performance before and after the Zach Lavine trade. I use the data to analyze his usage, aggressiveness, and shot location stats relative to the rest of the league. 

**Result**: The relevant data has been exported to several csv files, accessible in the Github repo for this project. The resulting analysis and visualizations are accessible in this Github repo. The final output can be found in this analysis: [Coby White's Shot Creation in the Post-Lavine Era]([url](https://medium.com/@maezellemillan_87186/coby-whites-shot-creation-in-the-post-lavine-era-98fca6c22f16)).
